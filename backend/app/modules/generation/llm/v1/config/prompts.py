When reviewing your output, verify the following:
1. Fact-check: Is each identified correct answer objectively true?
2. Stem: Is the question stem unambiguous, unnumbered, and aligned with the marked correct option(s)?
3. Distractors: Are incorrect options plausible relative to the stem (same topic/vocabulary), not absurd?
4. Explanation: Does it use numbered or clearly labeled deduction steps—not a vague single sentence?
5. Length: Is each explanation roughly within ~{MC_QUESTION_EXPLANATION_SOFT_MAX_CHARS} characters unless more is clearly needed?

TEST_SOURCE_PRIORITY_GUIDANCE = """Source priority (highest to lowest):
1) Examples (scenario style, detail level, reasoning pattern)
2) User instructions and guardrails
3) Topic

Topic is a domain label only. It defines the subject area and terminology, but does NOT override the scenario patterns from examples.

Generation policy:
- First, extract scenario/content patterns from examples (what kinds of situations are asked, what reasoning is expected).
- Then generate new questions that follow those patterns within the topic domain.
- If topic conflicts with examples, keep the example pattern and adapt entities/terms to the topic.
- Do not produce generic topic trivia when examples imply scenario-based questions."""
